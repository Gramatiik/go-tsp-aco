# TSP solver using Ant Colony Optimization

This project is a Go implementation of the **Ant System algorithm** proposed by M. Dorigo et al.

The main goal of this project was to produce a functional implementation of this algorithm and to test it against real world data to compare performance and accuracy of the algorithm. It was also a nice way to learn the basics of the Go language !

## Installation

Download the latest version for macOS under the releases section

## Build from source

> To build from source, you will need the [go language](https://golang.org/doc/install) compiler

Move to the project repository

Clone this repository and move to the sources directory

```bash
$ git clone <repository-url> go-tsp-aco
$ cd go-tsp-aco
```

```bash
$ go build main.go -o go-tsp-aco
```

And voil√† ! The compiler generated the binary file with the name `go-tsp-aco`
